            <p>In my Interface Design course (IAT 334), FRIJ was designed to enhance the home grocery experience. FRIJ enables users to <strong>effortlessly scan,
                 track, and organize their purchased groceries, while also offering personalized recipe suggestions based on their available ingredients.</strong></p>

                <h2>Research & Proposal | Week 1</h2>
                <h3>identifying the design domain</h3>
                <p>Seniors with physical or cognitive limitations who need assistance planning meals / nutrition.</p>
                <h3>research methodology</h3>
                <p>To gain an understanding of our target audience, we conducted both primary and secondary research. This research provided us with a few key insights to help understand the problem space 
                    and start developing solutions.</p>
                <h3>research insights</h3>
                <li>Seniors’ understanding of technology often hinders their motivation to seek help in the form of an app.</li>
                <li>Finding and selecting recipes that fit their nutritional needs while also tasting good can be very tough for seniors.</li>
                <li>While learning new technology, seniors prefer having help available at every step, often preferring clear step-by-step instructions to complete a task.</li>
                <li>Those with physical limitations often rely on others to retrieve groceries and other necessary goods which is an inconvenience and causes problems when others aren't available to help.</li>
                <li>Those without physical limitations often value their time spent grocery shopping, as many see it a source of social stimulation and physical exercise.</li>
                <li>Seniors who have issues with memory, as well as those who may leave their house for extended periods of time, often have trouble remembering how long they have had certain perishable food items, leaving them unsure about whether they are good to eat.</li>
                <h3>the problem statements</h3>
                <li>Getting the required daily nutrition for an elderly can be difficult and could take a long time when going through various recipes online or offline. This means making a decision on what taste good and has the necessary nutrition takes a long time. There’s an opportunity to plan meals faster and easier, thus improving the needed nutritional value for each and every senior.</li>
                <li>Elderly people value weekly outdoor activity as a form of exercise, especially when grocery shopping. This means that they may require assistance in carrying certain items or getting a list of items that they need. This opens the opportunity to allow 3rd party assistance or a way to remind seniors of getting what they need. </li>
                <li>Elderly people with memory issues may have issues remembering what meals or ingredients they have available, as well as forgetting how long certain perishable items have been in their fridge, creating situations of uncertainty about whether certain ingredients or leftover meals are still good to eat.</li>
                <h3>framing the problem</h3>
                <p>How might we empower seniors and boost their confidence when it comes to cooking and providing for themselves?</p>
                <p>How might we enable elderly users to conveniently get their groceries?</p>
                <p>How might we enable seniors to effectively track and remember details about what food and ingredients they have?</p>

                <h3>ideating the possible solutions</h3>
                <p>1. An app that suggests recipes based on the ingredients the user already has</p>
                <p>2. An app that tracks and reminds the user about expiry dates of their food</p>
                <p>3. A recipe app that aims to help the user easily acquire the ingredients they need</p>

                <h2>Idea & Interaction Framework | Week 2</h2>
                <p>In the second week, we brainstormed ideas to enhance the user experience. We crafted an interaction framework that mapped out how users would navigate the app. This provided a solid foundation for the design phase.</p>

                <h2>Designing Interactions | Week 3</h2>
                <p>Week three was dedicated to crafting the interactions that would guide users through FRIJ's features. We focused on creating seamless transitions and intuitive elements to enhance usability.</p>

            <div class="process_week">
                <h2>Interactive Prototype | Week 4</h2>
                <p>Building upon our interaction designs, we developed an interactive prototype of FRIJ. This allowed us to simulate the user journey and gather early feedback to refine our concepts.</p>

            <div class="process_week">
                <h2>Testing & Proposal Refinement | Week 5</h2>
                <p>During week five, we conducted usability testing on our interactive prototype. Based on user feedback, we iterated on our proposal and made refinements to further align with users' needs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="process_week">
                <h2>Final Design | Week 6</h2>
                <p>In the final week, we synthesized all our efforts into a polished and cohesive design. We finalized the visual elements, user flows, and interaction details to deliver a comprehensive user experience.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Working on the FRIJ grocery app was both invigorating and enlightening, marking my longest project to date. The project's multidisciplinary
                     challenges were captivating, especially the task of accommodating a wide user demographic, spanning from teens to the elderly. This experience
                      emphasized the paramount importance of inclusivity and accessibility, urging me to meticulously consider every design facet.</p>
                
                <p>The project also underscored the intricate nature of designing novel solutions, requiring unwavering commitment throughout research, ideation,
                     and testing phases. The lessons learned from FRIJ will undoubtedly resonate in my future projects, ensuring a continuous dedication to
                      user-centric and impactful design.</p>
